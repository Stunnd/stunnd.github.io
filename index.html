<a name="what-exactly-is-stunnd" class="anchor" href="#what-exactly-is-stunnd"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What exactly is Stunnd?</h3>

<p>Stunnd is a designer-friendly CSS grid that enables you to rapidly prototype websites. Stunnd is a flexible grid because you can use it as a fixed-width grid if you want, or as a full bleed stretched out, fluid grid if you want. This way, you don't limit yourself to either philosohpy and you can enjoy the pixel perfection of a fixed width grid while using a fluid grid under the hood.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-browsers-does-stunnd-support" class="anchor" href="#what-browsers-does-stunnd-support"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What browsers does Stunnd support?</h3>

<p>Technically, Stunnd supports from IE 6, but some features like rounded corners and drop shadows are available only from IE8 onwards. Stunnd supports mobile browsers, too.</p>

<h3>
<a name="licensing-and-costs" class="anchor" href="#licensing-and-costs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Licensing and costs.</h3>

<p>Stunnd costs you nothing if you are to use it for your personal projects and follow the Creative Commons Attribution license.</p>

<p>This includes your personal websites and blogs.</p>

<p>However, if you intend to use Stunnd for commercial projects, you need to buy a commercial license to waive off the requirements of attribution and non-derivative work.</p>

<h5>
<a name="what-is-the-personal-license" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-personal-license"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is the Personal License?</h5>

<p>The Personal License is for Freelancers and other designers who want to use the Stunnd CSS grid for their own personal projects. A good usage example would be personal websites or personal blogs. Note that, the <strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons NC, ND</a></strong> license implies usage of the software in accordance with the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The user agrees to link back to homepage of the project, in this case <a href="https://github.com/dsignr/stunnd/">https://github.com/dsignr/stunnd/</a>. The link should be prominent and should not be invisible.</li>
<li>The user agrees not alter or modify any of the classes inside the project file in any way.</li>
<li>The user agrees not to use the software for any commercial purposes.</li>
<li>The user agrees not to re-sell the CSS Grid <strong>separately</strong> and/or claim it their own. All licenses included in code must be intact and left untouched.</li>
</ul><h5>
<a name="what-is-the-commercial-license" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-commercial-license"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is the Commercial License?</h5>

<p>The Commercial License is for Small Businesses and Web Development companies who design and build interfaces, Web based and Mobile based software for a living. A good usage example would be commercial websites designed for clients in exchange for a fee. Note that, <strong>the Commercial License</strong> implies usage of the software in accordance with the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The user agrees not to re-sell the CSS Grid <strong>separately</strong> and/or claim it their own.</li>
</ul><p>However, the user:</p>

<ul>
<li>CAN develop software/interfaces based on this grid AND sell them and/or claim THAT software, collectively, their own.</li>
</ul><p>If you need to build more than 5 Commercial projects, then you can buy additional licenses as needed, or you can buy the Closed Source License.</p>

<h5>
<a name="what-is-the-closed-source-license" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-closed-source-license"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is the Closed Source license?</h5>

<p>The Closed Source License is for corporates and Small-Medium businesses and is exactly the same as the Commercial License, except that there is no limit on the number of Commercial projects with which this software can be used.</p>

<h5>
<a name="why-should-i-pay" class="anchor" href="#why-should-i-pay"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why should I pay?</h5>

<p>There is nothing stopping you from mis-using the provided software files. However, it is released in good faith that you will contact us/purchase when your project requirements match either of our Commercial Licenses. Plus, your payment will directly go into the overall development of this project and thus will benefit all of us involved, including you, ultimately.</p>
